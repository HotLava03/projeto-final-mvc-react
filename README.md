# Projeto Final MVC (React)

This project is intended for the migration of a PHP project into React. There's nothing much to it, other than pure reference.

## Configuration

Create a `config.json` file in the root of the project.

```json
{
  "homeUri": "http://localhost:3000/",
  "hostname": "localhost",
  "dbName": "projeto-final-mvc",
  "dbUser": "root",
  "dbPassword": "",
  "dbCharset": "",
  "defaultTitle": "Projeto Final MVC"
}
```

You're all set.

## Warning

This isn't done yet, so don't expect it to work at all. This line will be removed once finished.
